This folder contains notebooks that create virtual dataset reference files. Each notebook is devoted to a separate dataset. This folder acts as a library for us to keep track of the techniques needed to create a variety of virtual dataset reference files, since datasets with varying formats require tweeks to the code.

The notebooks in the "cases_for_debugging" folder are cases being worked on for VDS creation but have not been successful yet.
